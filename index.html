        <textarea id="message" rows="6">Respected Sir/Madam,

We, the students of the 8th semester at Shri Phanishwar Nath Renu Engineering College, Araria , 854318 respectfully submit this humble request for your kind consideration and support regarding a critical issue that is affecting many of us.

Due to low attendance during the current semester, several students are being denied the opportunity to fill out the examination form by the college administration. The semester duration was approximately 3 to 4 months—significantly shorter than usual—which severely impacted both class attendance and syllabus completion. As a result, a large number of students have fallen short of the 75% attendance requirement set by the university, despite our genuine efforts to keep up.

The last date for examination form submission is 15-05-2025, and without immediate intervention, many students face the serious risk of a year-back, which would adversely affect our academic and professional futures.

In light of this, we humbly request the following:

Extension of the examination form submission deadline, to allow time for resolving attendance issues.
Temporary reopening of the attendance portal for 3-4 days, enabling the college to conduct additional classes and record maximum possible attendance.
A one-time relaxation in the 75% attendance requirement, considering the exceptionally short semester and unavoidable circumstances.
We kindly request you to take this concern on a priority basis, so that a solution can be reached in time.

We remain hopeful for your understanding and assistance in safeguarding the future of the final-semester students.

Thank you very much for your support and consideration. We will always remain grateful to you. 

Warm regards,
On behalf of 8th Semester Students of
Shri Phanishwar Nath Renu Engineering College, Araria 854318</textarea>
